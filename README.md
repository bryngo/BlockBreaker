Simple blockbreaker game using Unity and C#. Blockbreaker is a game where the use could use there mouse or arrow keys to 
control a slider to hit a ball that goes randomly at angles and once it touches different blocks, it will break them. Once 
the user breaks all the blocks, the user wins. 

(Unfinished for now >_<)
